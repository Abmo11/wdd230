        <p class="explain">
          ChatGPT is Open AI’s main focus. Their mobile site says that through
          their design. They have used Hick’s Law to point to it without
          hesitation. Hick’s Law states that the time required to make a
          decision increases with every additional choice presented. This site
          starts out very clean with only two choices at the bottom (close to
          the thumbs when holding a mobile device) and the classic menu button
          sitting at the very top of the viewport - making it less accessible.
          Decision making is fast when the choices are concise and readily
          accessible: learn about GPT-4 or view the research.

        <h3>Proximity</h3>

        <p class="explain">
          Koenigsegg’s mobile site is aesthetic due to its main design
          principle: proximity. Proximity defines three main areas. The first
          sits at the top of the viewport and includes the company’s name and an
          elegant menu icon. The eye catches this naturally as it goes from top
          to bottom. The second is the center of attention: a supercar’s name in
          bold letters and a picture of it right underneath. There’s a link
          that’s related, right under the picture. The third is a chunk of empty
          space balancing the whole. Because of proximity, the eye’s main focus
          is the supercar, its name, and the link.

        <h3>Visual Hierarchy</h3>

          alt="Google Bard mobile site screenshot, describing it in small paragraphs">
        <p class="explain">
          Bard’s mobile site does a great job of pointing the visitor to its
          service using visual hierarchy in descending order. The first thing we
          catch are large, bold letters that sit at the top of the viewport.
          They summarize what Bard can do for you. The eye naturally moves down
          because of a chunk of whitespace underneath. This is followed by a
          small-type sentence that tells more about Bard. Under that sits a
          brief disclaimer on the technology. The last thing in the viewport is
          the inevitable button: “Join waitlist” - the info, fonts, space, and
          alignment in the viewport all point to this button.
